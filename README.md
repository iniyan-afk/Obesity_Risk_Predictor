Developed a deep learning model to predict obesity risk categories based on demographic and lifestyle features using a multiclass classification approach. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including handling categorical and boolean variables through one-hot encoding and label mapping. A custom neural network with four hidden layers and ReLU activation functions was implemented in PyTorch, optimized using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss. The model was trained over 500 epochs on GPU, achieving an accuracy of 82.5% on the test set. This project demonstrated practical skills in deep learning, model optimization, and data handling for real-world health-related prediction tasks.
